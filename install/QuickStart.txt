Quick Start to setting up your environment and executing the Cookbook recipes:

Download Chef Development Kit (ChefDK):
https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/redhat/

Installing ChefDK:
rpm -ivh chefdk-0.6.0-1.el6.x86_64.rpm

Verify Chef installed:
[root@propoc1 Chef]# rpmquery chef
chef-12.3.0-1.el6.x86_64

Untar Cookbook.zip file downloaded from Prolifics Space on your Linux box.  I untarred mine under /root.

For each cookbook there is a README.md file that provides details regarding the recipes and how to execute.  These cookbooks 
assume that the IBM installation binaries have previously been downloaded and exist on your filesystem.  Refer to each
Cookbook's attribute file (e.g. /cookbook/was/attributes/default.rb) to configure the attribute values that are specific to 
your environment.

There are two ways to execute the cookbook recipes... local-mode and server-mode.  You want to use local-mode which means
the cookbook recipes will be retrieve from a local repositiory (chef-repo) instead of being downloaded from a Chef server.
